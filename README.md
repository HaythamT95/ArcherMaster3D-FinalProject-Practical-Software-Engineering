Final project for my practical software engineering diploma.

A 3D developed game with C/C++ and OpenGL.

Players can finally show their true skills with arrow shooting. 
A challenging game that puts the player to his limits, competing with other players to reach top of the table with their score and show off with special tag to the 1st scorer player.

Players have to complete 3 levels, each level has it's own difficulty. 
First level the player has to shoot static targets and get as many point as he can by focusing on the inner circle. 
Second level it becomes harder, the targets are moving now, so the player have to calculate when it's the correct time to shoot the arrow. 
3rd and final level the player get a new challenging level, the world now has wind and the gravity increases and the world gets darker. 

All of this of course with time limit and limited arrows. But it's okay, players have the chance to get more time and arrows by collecting special box that an airplane comes and drops once in a while.
Another big feature in the game is that the player can customize his own level. Each player have to create an account in order to play the game. 
Of course player's progress is saved and have the ability to pause and continue whenever they want.

Make sure you have fun playing.
Game is created by Haytham Taweel and Walaa Meshleb
